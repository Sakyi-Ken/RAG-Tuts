`Learn the essentials of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance text generation accuracy. This path covers RAG basics, vector databases, semantic retrieval with embeddings, and building a complete RAG pipeline`

# Lessons
1. Introduction to RAG
2. Text Representation Techniques for RAG Systems;
    - Bag-Of-Words (BOW) Approach: _Counts words occurences and does not capture words order_
    - Embeddings: _Capture the relationship between words making similar sentences land near one another_
    - Embeddings Visualization Using t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding)
